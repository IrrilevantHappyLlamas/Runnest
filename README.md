# Runnest
## Description
Developed in the context of the course _CS-305 Software Engineering_ at École polytechinque fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Runnest is a Native Android running application that allows users to challenge each other in real time.

Unlike many other running applications, Runnest does not only provide tracking for your own running performances, but introduces a multiplayer experience: users can send challenges to any other runner using the application. Once the challenge starts, a split screen view lets the user see the progresses of his opponents towards the winning condition of that particular challenge.

Runnest ranked 2nd in the course internal competition that saw 16 teams competing with their application.
